## Commerce
This is an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that allows users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings and add listings to a "watchlist".

You can check under the **Specification** section from [the project document](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/2/commerce/) to learn about all the implemented features.
