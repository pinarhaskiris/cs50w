# commerce-proj
This is an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that allows users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings and add listings to a "watchlist".

I did this Django project to practice using Django models, migrations and user authentication.

**This is one of the projects I did for 'CS50W - Web Programming with Python and JavaScript' course given by Harvard University on edX.**
